# Don't apologise for not knowing something about Azure

Over the last few days I was trying to provide RCA for a customer problem that I worked on during an earlier on-call shift. The issue was specific to a niche networking area and someone suggested I consult a Network SME (after I have been investigating it for a few hours). I did and we worked on the issue together but didn't get anywhere in ~1 hour. As Networking is a huge area and my problem was - in the scheme of things - a low priority issue (resolved already - just RCA, and no immediate chance of reoccurring), the SME & I agreed that they would drop it for now.

When i did figure it out (several hours later) I sent the SME the detailed RCA for their information, and received an apology in response for them not being too much help because they were still learning the niche technology !!??.

People - please **don’t apologise for not knowing something about Azure**. If I did that, I’d still be apologising next century – and just the idea is exhausting.

I just assume from the start that I don’t know something & see if I can figure it out as I go, and hope that next time I have to figure something similar out I’ll be a little faster at it. It usually helps me a lot when people assist (like the SME did) and customers co-operate during the troubleshooting (I think of it as a team effort). Eventually (hopefully) if I do something enough times it will be unconscious and will appear to others as if I knew something but in reality I just didn’t think about what I was doing & somehow it ended up being the right thing.

**I don’t expect anything better from anyone else**. We (anyone outside the Engineering groups responsible for the development of that specific component) are too much of generalists and Azure (maybe all of IT) changes way too fast for specific unconscious knowledge to occur about it. The relevant IT fundamentals won’t change & they are mostly unconscious and that is where experience helps a lot – e.g. subnetting / VMs run on hosts / programming language fundamentals (variables / loops / decisions). Any relevant experience that you can share assists.

## Please don't apologise for not knowing something about Azure

It is far better to give me an indication that you can help a bit & then give it a go - working with me on the same thing, then to admit when you can't assist more (or cease providing assistance in some other way). Please don't waste my time & if you are 100% certain that you can't do anything other than waste my time, tell me that before you start & I'll find someone else. In the above case, the SME helped a lot through our interaction & we both learnt a lot - so maybe next time it will be a bit faster.
