Hi - I'm Nick Eales, I work at Microsoft and I'm based in Sydney Australia. For around 10 years until near the end of 2018 I worked in the Microsoft Premier Field Engineering team (many of the earlier posts in this blog are from that time). Near the end of 2018 I trsansitioned to an Azure Cloud Engineeer role within the Customer Experience team within Azure Engineering.

This blog is primarily as a location for me to document stuff so that I can find it again easily.. if it helps someone else, then that's great..  

This blog was moved from the TechNet blogs site when it was retired.
